This package contains a few handy classes that are collection like in 
nature.  The classes include handy general purpose Pair and Triplet classes
as well as a very handy Range class which uses a Sequence strategy that 
allows it to treat a Range discretely and iterate over Ranges and determine 
other useful properties when comparing Ranges such as abuts and the like.    

The package is licensed under the Apache License and all source must be 
handled according to the provisions of that license.
